=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MooseX::Types::Moose qw/Int/;    # import Int type constraint
    use MooseX::Lexical::Types qw/Int/;  # register Int constraint as lexical type

    my Int $foo;   # declare typed variable
    $foo = 42;     # works
    $foo = 'bar';  # fails

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to automatically validate values assigned to lexical
variables using Moose type constraints.

This can be done by importing all the MooseX::Types constraints you you need
into your namespace and then registering them with MooseX::Lexical::Types.
After that the type names may be used in declarations of lexical variables via
C<my>.

Values assigned to variables declared with type constraints will be checked
against the type constraint.

At runtime the type exports will still return C<Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint>s.

There are a couple of caveats:

=over 4

=item It only works with imported MooseX::Types

Using normal strings as type constraints, like allowed in declaring type
constraints for attributes with Moose, doesn't work.

=item It only works with scalars

Things like C<my Str @foo> will not work.

=item It only works with simple named types

The type name specified after C<my> needs to be a simple bareword. Things like
C<my ArrayRef[Str] $foo> will not work. You will need to declare a named for
every type you want to use in C<my>:

    subtype ArrayOfStr, as ArrayRef[Str];

    my ArrayofStr $foo;

=item Values are only validated on assignment

    my Int $foo;

will not fail, even if C<$foo> now holds the value C<undef>, which wouldn't
validate against C<Int>. In the future this module might also validate the
value on the first fetch from the variable to properly fail when using an
uninitialized variable with a value that doesn't validate.
